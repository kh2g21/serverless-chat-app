# serverless-web-app
Personal side-project where I designed a serverless real-time chat application using AWS Services (Lambda, WebSocketAPI & DynamoDB). Client written using JavaScript, HTML and CSS for the frontend. Backend is serverless. 

Go is used to serve the files for the chat application's frontend and act as an entry point for initial application. The chat functionality itself is handled by the serverless components (WebSocket API for real-time communication and Lambda functions to handle the backend logic).
